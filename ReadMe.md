# Building the Mod

1. **Build the Solution**: Use Visual Studio or your preferred build tool to build the project.

2. **Run the Game Once**: Before placing your mod in the game's mod directory, you need to run the main game at least once. This ensures that the necessary directories are created.

3. **Place the Mod in the Correct Directory**: After building your mod, you'll find the DLL file in the output directory. You must manually move this file to the game's mod directory.

   Example:
   \`\`\`
   Move YourMod.dll to C:\\Path\\To\\Game\\Mods
   \`\`\`

# Note

Make sure to place the mod in the correct directory, as mentioned above. The game must be run once to create the appropriate directories, and this is a crucial step to ensure that your mod will be recognized and loaded by the game.
